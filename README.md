ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Roberto Versari (@Rvers7), a teacher of Electronics in a secondary school in Italy.
Iâ€™m interested in simple but up to date educational applications to show my students all the possibilities opened by a solid know-how in Electronics. 
Iâ€™m currently learning VHDL intelFPGA programming and simulation (DE10Lite board), LTSpice simulation, PLC programming (both ladder and SCL) and IoT application development with ESP32 board and Node-Red. 
Iâ€™m looking for interesting material about these and other topics.
